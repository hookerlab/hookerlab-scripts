Scripts we use in our lab

## Overview

These are some scripts that we use in our lab. They are meant to be used in our computers, so probably they won't work in an outside machine. In any case, fell free to use them.
## Installation

The best way to install the scripts is to make copy them to a folder in your path.

1. Click on the buttom in the right column "Download ZIP"
2. If the file doesn't unzip automatically, double-click on in to unzip.

- If you are in Linux or Mac, open the "Terminal" program
- If you are in Windows, open the "Cygwin64" program
4. Type this command in the shell:
